### Zadatak A - Radovi na cesti

> Stari most je uski most i stoga postavlja ograničenja na promet. Na njemu istovremeno smije biti najviše 3 automobila koji voze u istom smjeru. Simulirati automobile procesom Auto koji obavlja niže navedene radnje. Napisati program koji stvara N automobila, gdje je N proizvoljan broj između 5 i 100 koji se određuje prilikom pokretanja programa te svakom automobilu dodjeljuje registarsku oznaku. Smjer se automobilu određuje nasumično.

✓

> Proces semafor određuje koji automobili će prijeći most, a početni smjer prijelaza se određuje nasumično te se zatim izmjenjuju. Prijelazak mosta se omogućuje kada se zabilježi 3 zahtjeva za prijelaz u trenutnom smjeru ili prođe X milisekundi, gdje je X slučajan broj između 500 i 1000. Prijelaz mosta traje Y milisekundi gdje je Y broj između 1000 i 3000.

✓

> Procesi međusobno komuniciraju uz pomoć reda poruka koristeći raspodijeljeni centralizirani protokol, gdje je proces Semafor odgovoran za međusobno isključivanje.

Za raspodijeljeni centralizirani protokol sam izmislio neki koji radi s tri reda poruka s jednim centralnim čvorom (centralni čvor zovem semafor, implementiran je u a_semaphore.c). Nisam implementirao neki od protokola obrađenih na predavanjima kao na primjer Lamportov protokol.

```c
Proces Auto(registarska_oznaka, smjer) {
   // smjer = 0 ili 1
   // registarska oznaka je redni broj automobila u sustavu
   spavaj Z milisekundi; // Z je slučajan broj između 100 i 2000
   pošalji zahtjev za prijelaz mosta i ispiši("Automobil registarska_oznaka čeka na prelazak preko mosta");
   po primitku poruke "Prijeđi" ispiši("Automobil registarska_oznaka se popeo na most");
   po primitku poruke "Prešao" ispiši("Automobil registarska_oznaka je prešao most.");
}
```

> Napomene:
>
> - Obavezno komentirati izvorni tekst programa (programski kod).
> - Sve što u zadatku nije zadano, riješiti na proizvoljan način.

Nisam htio pretjerati s komentarima.

### Zadatak B - Baza podataka

> Pretpostavimo da u sustavu imamo N procesa i jednu bazu podataka (u ovom slučaju baza se simulira nizom struktura podataka) koja za svaki proces struktura podataka procesa sadrži identifikator procesa, vrijednost logičkog sata procesa te broj ulazaka u kritički odsječak procesa. Neka je baza podataka dijeljena između procesa na način da je promjena vrijednosti od strane jednog procesa vidljiva svim ostalim procesima. Pristup bazi podataka predstavlja kritički odsječak: najviše jedan proces u svakom trenutku može biti u kritičkom odsječku. Unutar kritičkog odsječka, svaki proces ponavlja 5 puta sljedeće radnje.
>
> 1. U bazi podataka, ažurira svoju vrijednost logičkog sata trenutnom i inkrementira svoj broj ulazaka u kritički odsječak.
> 2. Ispiše sadržaj cijele (ne samo svog unosa) baze podataka na standardni izlaz.
> 3. Spava X milisekundi gdje je X je slučajan broj između 100 i 2000

✓

Tokom spavanja, moji procesi nisu responzivni. Blokiranu su.

> Na početku glavni proces stvara N  procesa (broj N se zadaje i može biti u intervalu [3,10]) koji dalje međusobno komuniciraju običnim ili imenovanim cjevovodima (svejedno). Sinkronizirajte pristupanje bazi podataka koristeći
>
> - Lamportov raspodijeljeni protokol (rješavaju studenti čija je zadnja znamenka JMBAG parna) ili
> - protokol Ricarta i Agrawala (rješavaju studenti čija je zadnja znamenka JMBAG neparna).

Implementirao sam R&A algoritam tako da svaki proces radi X ciklusa pristupa kritičnom odsječku. Ciklus završava izlaskom iz K.O. i obavještavanjem procesa koji čekaju odgovor, a odmah potom počinje novi ciklus gdje proces spava tako da se blokira na nasumičnu količinu vremena. Nakon što se proces probudi, on **ne gleda** ima li zahtjeva od drugih procesa za ulaskom u K.O., nego prvo pošalje svoj zahtjev za novi ulazak u K.O. i tek onda pokreće petlju u kojoj obrađuje zahtjeve i odgovore.

Zbog toga je kod napisane implementacije očekivano da će zbog ovakvih cikličkih zahtjeva za pristup kritičnom odsječku svi procesi, ako su na početku imali svi jednake vrijednosti, imati istu vrijednost lokalnog logičkog sata nakon što završi bilo koji ciklus. Kako tada procesi na početku svakog ciklusa imaju jednaku vrijednost lokalnog logičkog sata, tako će se svaki put sinkronizirati tako da proces s najvišim indeksom (jer njemu dajem prednost) uđe u K.O. I doista ako se postave svi logički satovi na istu vrijednost, onda će oni uvijek ulaziti istim redoslijedom u K.O. (od posljednjeg procesa prema prvom) i imati iste vrijednosti logičkih satova nakon završetka bilo kojeg ciklusa.

Ako su inicijalne vrijednosti logičkih satova postavljene nasumično, one će se djelomično istitrati nakon prvih ciklusa, ali ne moraju slijediti isto ponašanje koje je prethodno opisano.

Nakon što završe svi ciklusi, procesi ne spavaju nego jedan dio vremena obrađuju nadolazeće zahtjeve i jedan dio vremena spavaju. Nakon što je prošlo Y sekundi bez ijednog novog zahtjeva, proces se gasi i mota kablove.

> Napomene:
>
> - Bazu podataka možete definirati kao "struct db_entry database[N]".
> - Za dijeljenje baze podataka između procesa koristiti zajednički spremnik (sustavski pozive mmap ili shmat).
> - Svi procesi ispisuju poruku koju šalju i poruku koju primaju.
> - Obavezno komentirati izvorni tekst programa (programski kod).
> - Sve što u zadatku nije zadano, riješiti na proizvoljan način.

Koristio sam mmap. Procesi ispisuju poruke ako je uključena globalna zastavica DEBUG.
